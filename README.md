Fixes the issues with Geralt not spawning if using the hub mod.

 * Drag your save file (SAVEDATA1000) to the GerardoFix.exe program. 
 * Open Fix.bin on the Save Editor (https://github.com/AsteriskAmpersand/MHW-Save-Editor) (check the releases tab, not the code tab).
 and save encrypted as SAVEDATA1000 (over your save file) on your save directory. Pray.
 * If your character is not on slot 1 you can call the scripts as:
`GerardoFix.exe PATH_TO_SAVEFILE SLOTNUMBER`
