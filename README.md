Use the Save Editor (https://github.com/AsteriskAmpersand/MHW-Save-Editor) to open your file, save it unencrypted (drop down when "save as"). Drag the .bin unencrypted save file to the GerardoFix.exe program. Open Fix.bin on the save editor and save encrypted as SAVEDATA1000 on your save directory. Pray.
