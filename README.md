# MHW_Gerardo_Fix
Fixes the issues with Geralt not spawning if using the hub mod.
 * Save on the Research Base.
 * Make a backup of your save.
 * Ensure the game is closed from this point on.
 * Drag your save file (SAVEDATA1000) to the GerardoFix.exe program. Pray.
___
 * If your character is not on slot 1 you can call the scripts as:
`GerardoFix.exe "PATH_TO_SAVEFILE\SAVEDATA1000" SLOTNUMBER`
 * If you become unable to save just delete all files in the remote folder that aren't SAVEDATA1000 or SAVEDATAB
 ___
  * The fix is provided as is with no guarantee of working, it's unlikely I'll attempt to rewrite for every bizarre case there is as it's a pretty egregious blind patch.
